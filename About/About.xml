Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

In celebration of it being one year since I released my first mod to Steam, I have provided two gifts for everyone, this and [url=]the idlemancer[/url](has both an EBSG and a SHG version available).

This mod adds a single gene that makes pawns always super duper reproductive. I mean physics defyingly reproductive, in addition to it being biologically impossible. I'm talking, turned off my game and my colonist is still trying to get some lovin' impossible. You can find the gene in the reproduction section when ignore restrictions is enabled.
